This is my reponse

- Author is great writer
  - Examples within Examples
    - excessive commas, elipisis
  - Embarassing and revealing boxing story
  - Shows qualification through quotations and teaching stories
  - Reveals self with "Salaam alaikum", following his own advice to be different

- Is he helping his audience?
  - Goal is to inspire bad writers
    - won't help writers who don't want to learn
  - he pushed Victor away
    - "Please don't mix up your ignorance with Joyce's genius"
  - Yelling at Tamar to improve
    - maybe just a joke
  - Perfect enemy of the good
    - investigate the history of a poem before writing one
    - Tamar


- Stephen King "On Writing"?
  - You learn best by reading a lot and writing a lot, and the most valuable lessons of all are the ones you teach yourself.

Michael Mohammed Ahmad is a great writer. His teaching experience, literary references, and every engaging paragraph of his 14 page article, 'Bad Writer', make that clear. In the article he "seeks to inspire bad writers" that writing is a skill that must be practiced. While I won't dispute that Ahmad has the literary ability necessary to teach these writers, I do wonder if his attitude sabotages the goal.

Ahmad details his encounters with bad writers throughout his career. For example, he helps Victor, a long time workshop attendee and "Bad Writer" named Victor. Victor tried defending his technical writing errors as emulation of James Joyce's style. Ahmad reponded aggressively, "Please don't mix up your ignorance with Joyce's brilliance". Victor never came back. I doubt this bad writer was reformed. These quips are great punchlines for stories at a party, but do they ever actually help bad writers grow?

Writing is extremely personal. As Ahmad notes, it's our differences and personal experiences that make writing good. He shows that good writing reveals an impressive amount about the author. It's not surprising authors are self-conscious about their work.
With an identity based on being a good writer it's difficult to accept criticisms that you are in fact a bad writer. A more gentle teaching approach may be more effective for this type of writer.

Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed 'Bad Writer'. I even learned how original detail, research, and revealing oneself can improve a work. On the other hand, I'm not under the illusion that I'm a great writer. For his target audience of writers who "are no good, do not know it, do not want to find out, and are not interested in improving", I doubt they've changed their mind.
