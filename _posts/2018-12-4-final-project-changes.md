title: Project 3 Progress
---

Last week I presented my first week of progress on my final project. I talked about how automated recommendation systems help us find things that we like, but also change what we like. I wanted to show these receommendation systems in a tangible way to express the idea of making these hidden systems more tangible. As well, it allowed me to "own" my algorithm in a way. My prototypes from last week are shown below. Each one is an 3d printed 8x8 grid. The height of each cell represtents how frequently a particular genre of music is recommended to my by spotify.

The sessions last week helped was very useful for me. It helped me evaluated the good and bad parts of the project I had so far as well as possible directions to take it. Some of hte suggestions for things I should change were:

* print models for other people so that we can compare them
* print models using more data sources other than spotify
* use different colors, shapes, and designs in order to represent different things
* have some sort of key so that the model is interpretable
* show a time lapse of the actual print to represent how our preferences evolve over time
* use more abstract and interesting shapes

I decided to design more models for myself using different data sources. These include suggested jobs from LinkedIn and suggested friends from Facebook. This week I extracted and organized the data for these two new sources. I also designed a new model to be printed. The new model is a bit more abstract but still is somewhat interpretable. This was made using my suggested jobs from linkedin. Each bar represents the frequency of the job role suggested.
