title: Rights and Regulations

The article, "The Internet With A Human Face", made me curious about how we deal with data. In the present day there are so many companies collecting user data, buying data, and selling data. Yet, I have no idea of how this data is managed. I've heard of regulations such as GDPR that impose rules for the handling of personal data in the EU, but I'm not familiar with the rights it grants. The analogy of personal data to radioactive waste really makes me think about this problem. We are told of the promise that sharing more data will improve the experience of services, but it also creates a liability. Should this personal data just be deleted when companies are shut down?

Another responsibility that companies have is the safety of their products for consumers. An interesting point "Stealth Infrastructure" brought up was the problems with adoption of the cell-phone. In the early days of mobile devices we didn't foresee how popular they would become. It would be impossible to know how much exposure we would have to these devices. As a result, health and safety testing wasn't done until later. This makes me wonder at what point a company becomes responsible for guaranteeing the safety of their products. Is it really worth spending a great deal of resources on testing before a technology is even popular? Would requiring early in-depth testing be too much of a burden on small companies and stifle innovation?
