When new technology emerges we are eager to put it to use. Sometimes in this quest for progress, we assume that all of these applications are good. We assume that this new tech is scientific, unbiased, and pure. Dewey-Hagborg's work, 'Stranger Visions', tackles this false notion. As the artist explains, the purpose of her work is to put the emerging technology of forensic DNA phenotyping in the public eye. She aims to raise our awareness of the applications of this technology and frighten us into taking a more thoughtful approach to new tech.

Dewey-Hagborg's work is immediately striking. What's impressive about 'Stranger Visions' is how she's taken portraits, a classic art form, and subverted them. Typically the subject of a portrait must pose for the artist. They are well aware that the artist is depicting them. Instead, the subjects of Dewey-Hagborg's work have no idea their faces are up on a wall. They never consented to this and probably don't even know it happened. In this way the artist inspires fear in her audience and makes them consider how the data they don't know they left behind could be used for any purpose.

While her work clearly raises questions about privacy, some important ideas aren't addressed. A key point of the artist's related essay, 'Sci-Fi Crime Drama With A Strong Black Lead', is the idea of genetic determinism and opportunities for racial discrimination. As the portraits are presented, we assume that they accurately portray their real-life subjects. This hides the fact that there is no genetic basis for race. We don't recognize that the appearance of these models is just a guess and not based on proven science. A possible way that the artist could have conveyed this is by presenting images of the actual subjects next to the renders. We could then compare the two representations and see how distinct they are. This of course would require her to know their identities, but it also might make the work more striking.
