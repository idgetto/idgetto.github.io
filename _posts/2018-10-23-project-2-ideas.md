title: Hidden Internet
---

For our second project Seungin and I are examining what's hidden on the internet. After an ideating session we have identified various elements that are hidden online as well as elements that prominently displayed to hold our attention. In order to communicate a hidden aspect of the internet, we've decided to swap these two elements. What used to be hidden will now be announced, and what was announced will now be hidden.

Below are some of these elements that we have identified.

Hidden Elements:
- terms and conditions
- tracking pixels
- personal data collection
- what data is stored
- where our data is stored

Announced Elements:
- ads
- content

Some project ideas that came out of these are the following.

Project Ideas:
- In place of a website's ads, show the terms and conditions instead.
- Print out all the terms and conditions we've agreed to display their volume and the amount of legally binding contracts we must uphold.
- Create a physical network of people and pass secret info as notes.
- Generate a geographical map of were each website stores its data around the world.
