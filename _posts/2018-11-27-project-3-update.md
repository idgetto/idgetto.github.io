title: Project 3 Update
---

For my final project I'm interested in exploring AI through recommendation systems. We usually think about these as the good side of automation. An application with great benefits and few drawbacks. Instead of considering the merits of this type of AI, I'm focused on how these sytems affect us. More than just exposing us to things we might like, these suggestion systems influence who we are.

My past two projects have taken the form of webpages. Now, I'd like to my final project to take the form of a visual art piece. Additionally, I think the idea ownership of our algorithms is interesting. Do I own my algorithm? This is why I've chosen to present my piece as a 3d sculpture that's literally tangible. In this way I can hold onto some representation of my algorithm.

By gathering the suggestions of these systems and quantifying them as data points I'm able to 3d print a concrete representation. After distilling this data down into a single object, I'll be left with an encoded reflection of who I am. In a way, this object is a collaborative self portrait. It represents me, but has also been shaped by AI. I hope looking at this object will make the viewer consider how automated systems shape our preferences and interests today and how that role used to be filled by other humans.
