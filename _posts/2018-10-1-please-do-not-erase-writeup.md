title: Please Do Not Erase Writeup

Inspiration:
- Stranger Visions

The inspiration for my web page, [Please Do Not Erase](/2018-9-29-please-do-not-erase), comes from a work by Heather Dewey-Hagborg. Her piece, [Stranger Visions](https://deweyhagborg.com/projects/stranger-visions), examines the objects that people leave behind on a day to day basis. By collecting gum, cigarette butts, and hair she attempts to obtain information about who left them behind. She extracted DNA from each of the samples and then generates 3d printed portaits of the individuals. She presents these striking life-size portraits along with the objects that help produce them.

Her work encourages us to think about what data we leave behind without thinking. Wether it be gum on the street, or our birth date on the web, we ought to be more thoughtful about what we share. In some instances we can't avoid leaking this presonal information everywhere we go. Physically we leave hair and skin cells behind. It seems like the only way to prevent this is to wear a hazmat suit whenever we go out. On the web we face similar challenges. Privacy has become difficult to preserve withough resorting to extreme measures.

Dewy-Hagborg's work is also a criticism on how we use technology. While tech can create huge benefits for society, we don't always consider the drawbacks. In terms of the genetic research that generated her portraits, we get the benefit of putting a face to an object, but we have no way of validating it's accuracy. Too often we look at data coming out of computer as pure fact. Instead, we should regard it with the same skepticism we do for informations presented by humans. Just because a computer can take a human out of the equation doesn't mean the bias is gone.

On my page, Please Do Not Erase, I attempt to highlight similar ideas as Dewey-Hagborg and present them in a new way. The page is composed of images captured around Olin's campus. Each one is an illustration, drawing, or writing left on a board in a classroom. These boards don't get erased very often and contain content that can be puzzling an interesting out of context. By cataloging these remnants of lectures and activities I was able to get a limited snapshot of academic life at Olin. I then extracted all of the words in each photo and recorded them. Each time the web page loads a random selection of photos is presented. Below the images are 3 randomly selected words from the photo. By clicking on the image you are brought to the first google result when those 3 words are searched.

My project takes a much more playful approach than Dewey-Hagborg's. This helps clarify an idea that can easily be missed in her work. When we see the generated portraits in Stranger Visions we may believe them to be completely accurate. It's not apparent that in reality, they are most likely very wrong. On the other hand, my work takes a photo and brings you to another web page with only a disparate connection to the photo's content. Hopping around the web like this makes it clear that although a computer is being used to find a connection it might not be meaningful whatsoever.
