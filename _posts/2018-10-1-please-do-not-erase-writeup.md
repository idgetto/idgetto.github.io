title: Please Do Not Erase Writeup
---

Michael Mohammed Ahmad is a great writer. His teaching experience, literary references, and every engaging paragraph of his 14 page article, "Bad Writer", make that clear. In the article he "seeks to inspire bad writers" that writing is a skill that must be practiced. While I won't dispute that Ahmad has the literary ability necessary to teach these writers, I do wonder if his attitude sabotages the goal.

Ahmad details his encounters with bad writers throughout his career. For example, he helps Victor, a long time workshop attendee and 'Bad Writer'. Victor tried defending his technical writing errors as emulation of James Joyce's style. Ahmad responded aggressively, "Please don't mix up your ignorance with Joyce's brilliance". Victor never came back. I doubt this bad writer was reformed. These quips are great punchlines for stories at a party, but do they ever actually help bad writers grow?

Writing is extremely personal. As Ahmad notes, it's our differences and personal experiences that make writing good. He shows that good writing reveals an impressive amount about the author. It's not surprising authors are self-conscious about their work. With an identity based on being a good writer it's difficult to accept criticisms that you are in fact a bad writer. A more gentle teaching approach may be more effective for this type of writer.

Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed "Bad Writer". I even learned how original detail, research, and revealing oneself can improve a work. On the other hand, I'm not under the illusion that I'm a great (or even good) writer. For his target audience of writers who "are no good, do not know it, do not want to find out, and are not interested in improving", I doubt this article has changed their mind.
