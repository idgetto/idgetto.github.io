These days so much of our data lives online. We understand that we voluntarily distrubite this information for servinces we sign up for and that our usage activity is also being recorded. Additionally, we know that some of this information is transfered and sold to other parties online. Over the years more and more of this data accumulates. Without too much thought on our part this mass of data grows. With Google's Takout service we can get a glimpse of this information. Through this export service, Google lets users donwload an archive of their data from numerous Google services such as Google Maps, Hangouts, and Search. Facebook and LinkedIn offer similar export services.

This wealth of data has made me consider my "Digital Estate" and how it gets managed. I wonder how much of my life is recorded online automatically and who will look back on it in the future. I've realized we live in a unique time. Right now every online user is helping to co-author their own digital biography. Every conversation, search, and web activity is recorded automatically. I have trouble remebering conversations from a few days ago, but every letter of my chats from a decade ago are still remembered in a database.

By creating this final project in the form of a booklet I took this online data and put it on paper. The shape of the book is my silhouette. I want this to suggest how this data inside is personal to me and tells a story about me. I hope that representing a fraction of my data online in this physical form causes the viewer to consider how the information we have online already acts as a biography.
